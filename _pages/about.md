Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University. My research focus is on developing robust machine learning systems to solve real-world, practical problems. Some of my prior work includes training embedding-based language models to learn musical emotion from social media conversations, developing a state-of-the-art smart compost bin for automatically measuring household food waste using a novel computer vision model, and helping businesses automate critical data analytics and cybersecurity workflows with large database management systems. I'm interested in end-to-end data-driven solutions; working on complex research problems to produce new datasets, build effective data management pipelines, and develop novel deep learning models to deliver insights quickly and effectively.
