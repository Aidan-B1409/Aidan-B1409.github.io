Hi! I'm a CS student at Oregon State University. My focus is developing robust and maintainable data pipelines and building machine learning systems for new and interesting problems. Previous work includes web scraping and social media data mining, statistical NLP methods, and working with deep learning language understanding models. I'm interested in end-to-end solutions that handle data gathering, analysis, and prediction to deliver results quickly and effectively.
