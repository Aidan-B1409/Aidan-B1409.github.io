The task of music emotion recognition has been of interest in the music information retrieval domain. We investigate the use of online social media discussions as a potential input for music emotion prediction models. Using this commentary, we evaulate the performance of two pre-trained large language models in predicting the valence and arousal of a piece of music. We query three social media platforms to build a corpus of conversations surrounding 2,402 songs. We achieve modest Pearson's correlations of 0.62 and 0.72 to valence and arousal targets respectively. These results demonstrate that there may be a connection between the sentiment expressed in the online discourse around a song and a listener's affective response to said song.
