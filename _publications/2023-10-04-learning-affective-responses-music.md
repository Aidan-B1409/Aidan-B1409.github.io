The ability to automatically estimate typical affective responses to music would enable the development of emotion-aware music recommendation systems. However, the lack of suitable datasets for this task has hindered attempts to design such systems. In this work, we introduce social media conversational data as a new feature space for music emotion recognition. We create a large dataset of social media musical discourse with over 11.8 million comments from Reddit and YouTube discussing 19,627 different songs. We fine-tune large language models on this conversational data in a two-target regression task to predict music valence and arousal annotations. We demonstrate a modest ability to estimate human annotated music emotion targets directly from social media comments. Our highest performing model achieves Pearsonâ€™s correlations of 0.80 and 0.79 for valence and arousal, respectively. These results imply that emotive qualities of a song may be inferred directly from social media conversations, without access to the audio or lyrics.
